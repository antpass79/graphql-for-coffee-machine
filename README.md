# GraphQL for Coffee Machine

GraphQL example with Angular, Node.js and Asp.Net Core

Thinking an easy program to learn GraphQL, when I was at work in front of my friend, the coffee machine, I decided that my friend could be a good starting point for the goal.
So what I wanted were 2 things:

- querying a subset of data
- managing different sources
- mutating some data
- handling subscriptions

For the moment the above aims can be enough.

## Run the Coffee Machine

Coffee Machine has different components:

- coffee-machine is the front end
- graph-gateway manages data from queries and mutations
